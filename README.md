# Fantasy-Cricket-League-Game
It is a Python GUI based project(pyqt5) where you can create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points depending on how your chosen players perform in real life matches.

# Approach
- Each player has their own Points.
- There will be a limited no. of points allocated to create a new team.
- It is limited to 11 players, and the team is evaluated using the points of each player they gained using the real life match data. 
- To win a tournament, we must try to get the maximum points and reach No. 1 rank amongst other participants.
